      <p>The abuse of substances is a growing epidemic affecting individuals across various age groups and communities, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/what-we-do/emergency-response/current-emergencies/ongoing-emergencies" target="_blank">deemed a public health crisis.</a></p>

      <p>Throughout New York state, various substances, including marijuana, opioids, cocaine, alcohol, and other drugs, impact a diverse demographic. The use of opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, has grown significantly over time, contributing to a proportional rise in opioid-related deaths. In New York City, the nation's most populous city, there is a growing concern about opioid-related fatalities, with a 12% increase in overdose deaths in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank">2022 compared to 2021.</a></p>

      <p>To address the ongoing challenge, there is an increasing need for substance abuse programs, as individuals urgently require assistance before reaching a critical point. These programs are designed to aid those grappling with issues such as alcoholism, opioid dependency, and marijuana/cocaine abuse, among other substance-related struggles.</p>

      <p>With the escalating opioid epidemic and a reduction in societal taboos, numerous treatment centers have emerged throughout the counties of New York. These facilities offer diverse program categories and service types, aiming to address a broad spectrum of challenges and requirements.</p>

      <p>Analysis of substance abuse program data within New York Counties reveals a notable trend among younger adults, specifically those aged 24-35, who are turning to heroin and other opioids more frequently than individuals in other age groups.</p>

      <iframe title="Admissions to substance use disorder treatment programs in New York state, organized by age group, and primary substance." aria-label="Bar chart" id="datawrapper-chart-4Hxsr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4Hxsr/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="692" data-external="1"></iframe>
      <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

      <p>This chart demonstrates the admissions number into varying substance abuse treatment programs in different New York state counties from 2007-2021, organized by age group and primary substance, from data collected by <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Substance-Use-Disorder-Treatment-Program-Admission/ngbt-9rwf/data" target="_blank">New York State Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS)</a>. From the NYS OASAS data, it is seen that younger adults specifically, ages 24-35, are turning to heroin and other opioids at their primary substance of choice, more than any other age group, differing from the oldest age group, 45 and above, whose primary substance is alcohol.</p>

      <p>On the contrary, the predominant substance reported for admissions among the youngest age group (under 18) is Marijuana, acknowledged as a potential gateway drug. Studies show that Marijuana use frequently precedes the consumption of other <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug" target="_blank">illicit substances</a>, diminishing the reactivity of brain dopamine reward centers in adulthood.</p>

      <p>As a result, adults with a history of regular marijuana use may face an elevated vulnerability to addiction or misuse, often seeking relief from unhappiness.</p>

      <p>Enter: Opioids.</p>
      <p><a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/opioid-epidemic/#:~:text=3.10%20million%20people%20abused%20opioids,people%20abused%20heroin%20last%20year" target="_blank">According to the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics</a>, almost 50,000 people die every year from an opioid overdose, and over 10 million people misuse opioids in a year.</p>

      <p>In New York specifically, opioids are a factor in 80.9% of all overdose deaths, and that number has only been increasing with time. From 1999-2019, overdose deaths involving



      <p>So…why is this happening? What is driving this big increase and what can be done to stop it? To delve into the underlying causes of these alarming trends, it is essential to understand the driving forces behind the increase in substance abuse.</p>


      <p>Kathryn Dishaw, manager of Crouse Health Addiction Treatment Services, provides insights into the growing effects of the epidemic.</p>

        


      <p>As a manager, Dishaw oversees patient services in outpatient settings, including the opioid treatment program. This involves coordinating various aspects such as medication administration, individual and group counseling, evaluations, and any other components related to outpatient treatments for patients.</p>
        
      <p>Dishaw states that the average age group at the treatment center is in the late 30s to 40s, with the range beginning after 18. There have been only a few cases where they've dealt with younger individuals, with the consent of a parent.</p>

      <p>Dishaw notes that, in the treatment center, alcohol is found to be the most frequently used substance among older populations, from after 45 and on. This revelation very closely mirrors findings previously mentioned, from NYS Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS).</p>

        <P>When asked about the rest of the demographic, Dishaw shares, "Across all ages, opioids are the substance we see most frequently. Due to the epidemic, we service a lot of patients using opioids, including opioids, heroin, oxycodone, fentanyl... etc." </P>In 2011, according to Crouse Health Addiction Treatment Service data, there was a shift from alcohol to opioids as the primary substance, with opioids ranking higher than any other substance.


        <p>Dishaw began working at the treatment center around 2014-2015.</p>
      
        <p>“At that point, we had waiting lists for programs, with more patients on waiting lists than programs,” Dishaw shares. She adds that at that time, the demand for an opioid treatment program was so high, and they were the only program in the community providing exactly that, including special services and medication.

        <p>According to the treatment centers data, starting in 2016, was when Onondaga County truly witnessed a significant uptick in opioid-related deaths. This trend makes sense as it coincided with the notable expansion of their waiting list and program during that time period. </p>

       <iframe title="New York Counties summarized by total the number of admissions into substance abuse treatment programs for heroin/other opioids." aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-YEyAg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YEyAg/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="689" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      By looking at this map, it can be seen that Onondaga county is a hotspot for opioids, listing as one of the top ten counties in New York state for number of admissins for heroin/opioids, with New York County (Manhattan) being number one, followed by kings county (Brooklyn) and then the Bronx.
       
        <p>“Opioids have skyrocketed over the past couple of years, unfortunately, taking over." said Dishaw.</p>


        <p>The community in response, has acknowledged and addressed the alarming surge in opioid-related deaths. In the past decade, a notable increase in the number of programs has occurred around New York state, and the availability of such programs has quadrupled. 

        <p>However, Dishaw shares that despite efforts to address the opioid crisis, data from Onondaga County indicates that opioid deaths have not decreased, even with the increase in the number of, and accesibility to treatment programs. </p>
        <p>This underscores the complexity of the issue and raises questions about the effectiveness of current interventions. </p>
       
        <p>The narrative surrounding substance abuse in New York reflects a multifaceted challenge that necessitates continued attention, research, and comprehensive strategies to mitigate the impact on communities, all over the United States.</p>
